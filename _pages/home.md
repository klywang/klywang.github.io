I'm a computational scientist with 5 years of research experience applying statistical analysis,
signal processing, image analysis,
and machine learning to the study of [quasicrystals](https://dictionary.iucr.org/Quasicrystal). 
I have experience with open-source software development for
scientific computing in Python and 2 years of research experience in deep learning for protein interface prediction.

<h2>Selected Projects</h2>
<b>Grain Interactions in Quasicrystals</b>
* Designed molecular dynamics simulations to model and explore pheonmena observed by experimental collaborators
with the goal to quantify and understand the role of complexity in aperiodic crystal growth.
* Applied 
<b>Deep Learning for Protein-Protein Interface Prediction</b>
* Implemented multi-node geometric deep learning model in <i>Tensorflow</i> to predict protein-protein interfaces using 3D point cloud representations.
* Evaluated the performanece of various image segmentation metrics and loss functions on protein-protein interface segmentation.
