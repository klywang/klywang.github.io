      My research in the 
      [Glotzer Group](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/)
      focuses on the structures and growth interactions of
      [quasicrystals](https://dictionary.iucr.org/Quasicrystal).
      <!--These discovery of the beautiful materials challenged the prevaling paradigms of crystallography,-->
      <!--and ultimately our very definition of the word -->
      <!--[crystal](https://dictionary.iucr.org/Crystal).-->

      Join me as I learn about Fourier space and crystallography,
      or, maybe, just stop by to read a piece of creative writing
      or my own journey with world building and writing.
